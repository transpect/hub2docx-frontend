# hub2docx-frontend

Create .docx files from Hub or DocBook XML.

Another file that you’ll have to provide is a (possibly empty) .docx file that serves as a template for styles etc.

This is the standalone front-end project that you can use do derive your project from. It is using several other libraries, 
as [ext externals](http://nopugs.com/ext-tutorial) or git submodules. If you prefer svn externals, you’d have to create a front-end repo
in a genuine svn server because github’s svn implementation does not include svn externals.
